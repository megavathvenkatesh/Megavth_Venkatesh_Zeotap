# Customer Segmentation and Look-Alike Modeling

This project performs customer segmentation and look-alike analysis using clustering, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, and transaction metrics. The scripts generate visualizations, reports, and insights for understanding customer behavior.

## **Project Files**

1. **`Megavath_Venkatesh_EDA.py`**
   - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer, transaction, and product datasets.

2. **`Megavath_Venkatesh_Clustering.py`**
   - Prepares features for clustering using RFM analysis.
   - Performs clustering with K-means and visualizes clusters.
   - Generates detailed reports of clustering results.

3. **`Megavath_Venkatesh_LookAlike.py`**
   - Creates customer features.
   - Finds look-alike customers based on customer similarity metrics.
